# TODO

- attack in groups instead of sending single units
- mark my contribution with HS
- add logs

# Optional

- poor building location placement --> trying to build addons failed due to missing space --> more distance to other buildings
- Lower supply depot

# Out of scope

- addon swapping (buildings switching places)
  - instead bot will build required building if unit cannot be build
