# TODO


- mark my contribution with HS

# Optional

- delete checkTrainAddon??
- poor building location placement --> trying to build addons failed due to missing space --> more distance to other buildings
    - note: will not rebuild since building can be used
- Lower supply depot
- attack in groups instead of sending single units

# Out of scope

- addon swapping (buildings switching places)
  - instead bot will build required building if unit cannot be build
